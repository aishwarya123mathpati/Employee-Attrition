# Predicting Employee Attrition Using Supervised Machine Learning

Employee attrition is an important business problem. By predicting whether an employee is likely to leave, companies can proactively take measures to retain talent. This project uses a dataset with various employee attributes, applying supervised machine learning algorithms to classify whether an employee will stay or leave the company.

Problem Statement
 - Given an employee's data, predict if the employee will leave the company (attrition) or not.

The output will be a binary classification:

 - 1 for Attrition (employee left the company)
 - 0 for No Attrition (employee stayed with the company)


Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data handling
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for running the project

Classifiers trained to solve this problem statement - 
- LogisticRegression
 - DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree: 
 - RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble: 
 - XGBClassifier from xgboost: 
 - SVC from sklearn.svm:
